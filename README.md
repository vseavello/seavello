# seavello
new seavello website

This repository will be where we keep the code for the seavello.com website. We're going to create something new, 
something different from the previous site.

It's worth noting that github will allow hosting of a webpage, as long as it doesn't contain server side scripting.
HTML, Javascript, and probably event jQuery are allowed, but we'll need a server somewhere hosting the backend. For 
this reason, we'll host the entire website somewhere else.

Our website will make use of:

- PHP
- MySQL
- jQuery
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

This list will be modified as we determine what we want to accomplish.
